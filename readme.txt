HDForms. The easiest way to create contact forms.

== Description ==

HDForms. The easiest way to create contact forms
======

HDForms was designed and built to be a super easy system to create contact forms of any size. The forms are automatically validated for user input, sanitized for security, and, of course, sent without fuss! HDForms comes with an easy to use visual form builder, and can be used for small contact forms, intake forms, request for quotes, or large applications.

With HDForms, you can even intelligently show or hide certain fields with ease - no coding required!

## ‚ùì HOW TO USE | TUTORIAL ‚ùì


Full tutorial and documentation is still being written. This section, along with a link to the full documentation will be updated ASAP.

Once a form has been created and saved, you can use the build-in Gutenberg block, or you can just copy and paste the shortcode anywhere on the site to render the form. You can also use WordPress's do_shortcode() function to render the form:
`
<?php echo do_shortcode("[hdf form = "formId"]"); ?>
`


### Triggers

You can view the HDForms **About / Options page** to see an example of how triggers and toggles work.

Setting up triggers is by far the most complicated thing to do, but I hope that this quick tutorial will help.

You'll need to know two things in order to create triggers. The trigger element, and the toggle element. The trigger element is the element that we check if its input has changed, and the toggle element is the element we either show or hide. In the above example, the trigger element is the checkboxes (specifically the one for "other"), and the toggle element is the text input.

In HDForms, each element you create gets a special and unique ID. You can find this ID by selecting the element to edit it. You'll need to get the ID of the¬†trigger element and paste it into the¬†toggle element's "Trigger Element" field. That's it! By default, the toggle element will remain hidden unless the trigger element gets some data.

But what about, for example, like above, where I only want the toggle to happen if a certain checkbox is selected? In this case, we also want to pass along what "option" we want the trigger to work on (note: this is only for radio or checkboxes). This can be easily done by adding `[x]` to the end of the ID, where `x` is the number of the option. So in the above example, "other" is the fourth (4) listed option, so I would append `[4]` to the end of the ID. A full example trigger element id might look something like this `hdf_3481_checkbox_oxpkhp[4]`

== Installation ==

The plugin can be installed like any other.

1. Log into WordPress
1. Select Plugins, then Add New
1. Select Upload Plugin
1. Choose the zip file, then Install and activate

Once installed, you will need to select HDForms from the left sidebar to create a new form. Once a form has been saved, a shortcode will be visible on the content tab. You can copy/paste this shortcode onto any post or page to show the form.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= I am not receiving emails =

HDForms uses WordPress' built-in wp_mail() function to send emails. This means that if your site or server is not properly configured, then not only will HDForms not be able to send email, but WordPress itself won't be able to either.

The first thing to do is install the [Check Email plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/check-email/) to test your site settings. The error message you get will help you find out where the issue lies.

The most likely culprit is SMTP. The [WP Mail SMTP ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) may help you set up your SMTP settings.
